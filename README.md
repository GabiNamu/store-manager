# Store Manager
Store Manaager was a project made for study purpose and it was my first time using layered architecture (Model, Service and Controller) in Node.
### In this project I:
- developed a RESTful API, that is a sales management system in dropshipping
format where it will be possible to create, view, delete and update products and sales;
- Develop some endpoints that will read and write:
  - MySQL database;
  
### Main technologies:
- Docker;
- JavaScript;
- Node.js;
- Express;
